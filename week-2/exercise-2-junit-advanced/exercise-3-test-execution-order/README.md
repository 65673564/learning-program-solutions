# Sub-Exercise 3: Test Execution Order

## Scenario:
In some cases, tests need to follow a specific order for setup or logical flow.

## Objectives:
- Use `@TestMethodOrder(MethodOrderer.OrderAnnotation.class)`
- Apply `@Order(n)` to control test execution sequence
- Ensure predictable test behavior when needed
