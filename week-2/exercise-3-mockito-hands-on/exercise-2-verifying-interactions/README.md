# Sub-Exercise 2: Verifying Interactions

## Scenario:
You want to make sure a specific method in a mock object was called, how many times, and with what parameters.

## Objectives:
- Use `verify(mock).method(...)`
- Use `verify(mock, times(n))`
- Use `verify(mock, never())` to confirm no interaction
